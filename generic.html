							<p>An online multiplayer Battle Royale where the players form crews of three pirates face each other in deadly combat. Sail with your space ship in a three-dimensional enviroment with total freedom of movement and rotation. Loot, equip your ship, shoot your cannons, board the enemy, sabotage their ship and raze them. The last crew win.</p>
							<p>My main role inside the team was Game designer, focused in the level design, in which I was involved since the very begining, designing, greyboxing, testing, iterating and implementing both the main ship and the level. I also had a very close relationship with the Art Department, since we had to create the concept for the game world together and make sure that all the elements where atractive to the eye as well as being useful for gameplay.</p>
							<p>I also worked with the rest of the Design Department creating and prototyping all the game mechanics, systems, UI/UX, etc.</p>
							<p>The game is currently in development. We went to Madrid Games Week 2019 so real players could try it and we got a lot of positive feedback from almost 600 people that played Blackstorm.</p>
							<p>We also went to Fun&Serious Game Festival, where the game was a success and we have all kinds of players coming to play battle after battle during the whole Festival. We had the greatest honor when Blackstorm won the Best University Project Award.</p>
							<p>Last but not least, we also went to the PlayStation Talents ceremony where Blackstorm won the Best Game for the Press Award, so I couldn't be happier since this is a proof that hardwork is worth it.</p>
